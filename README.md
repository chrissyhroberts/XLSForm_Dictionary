# XLSForm_Dictionary
Makes a simple data dictionary from an XLSForm in xlsx format

This is a work in progress so the readme is not going to do much for you.

Feed it an xlsx form and it will give you an html output in human readable data dictionary. 

Currently doesn't really respect nesting of groups or repeats. 
Can't handle complicated things like relationships or external csvs.
Probably can't deal with lots of things really
But it isn't a bad start

Written with lots of support from ChatGPT 4o as I really don't know anything about working with xlsx forms.
